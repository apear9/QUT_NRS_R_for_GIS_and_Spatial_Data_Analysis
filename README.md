# QUT_NRS_R_for_GIS_and_Spatial_Data_Analysis

This repository contains resources for the "R for GIS and Spatial Data Analysis" workshop run by the QUT Natural Resources Society. 

### Contents

This repository contains three sets of resources:

1. The guidebook for the workshop (as a PDF) and the .Rmd file which was used to compile it. (Note that the package `rmarkdown` and a valid installation of LaTeX are required if you intend to compile the PDF yourself.)
2. The spatial data used in the workshop. These are the same as the various `meuse` datasets found in the package `sp`. However, these have been written out as shapefiles and rasters for demonstrative purposes.
3. A series of scripts (.R files) which contain the code blocks used throughout the workshop. 

### Instructions for attendees

Attendees of the workshop can simply download this repository as a .zip folder and unzip the file on their own computers. It is possible to clone the directory also but please note I will not be accepting pull requests -- this repository is to hold the materials for the workshop only.
